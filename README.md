## Overview  
This is a simple console application that uses a Goal Seek approach to find the budget for a specific ad that fits a desired total budget. 

Note: As a beginner in C#, I will keep the GUI for the challenge simple.

## This project uses the following dependency:

- [Spectre.Console 0.49.1](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console) - A library that makes it easier to create beautiful console applications.

## Running the Application

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/90barricade93/Goal-Seek-Application
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory
```sh
cd Goal-Seek-Application
```

### 3. Build the application
```sh
dotnet build
```

### 4. Run the application
```sh
dotnet run
```

### 5. Follow the in-app instructions
The optmizing tool will guide you through the process of inputting.

## Test cases

CASE 1:

</div>


## Final words
The optimal budget for the specific ad can go negative in certain scenarios. This can happen when the agency fee, third-party tool fee, and fixed cost for agency hours exceed the total campaign budget. In such cases, the tool is indicating that the specific ad should not be allocated any budget to achieve the highest possible total revenue.

It is important to note that this is a simplified optimization tool and may not take into account all the complexities of a real-world campaign. It is always a good practice to review the results and consider other factors before making final decisions on budget allocation.
